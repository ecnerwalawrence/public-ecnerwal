1. Build Instructions:

  a) Compiled in 32bit RedHatLinux-4.x. GNU gcc-3.4.6

  b) dependencies:
        - cppunit-1.12.0-2
        - boost-1.44.0-1_02
     You can put the headers in shared libraries in ./deps/include and ./deps/lib 
     or change the Makefile

     * INCLUDES = (header file locations)
     * LDDLIBS = (shared objects locations)
     * CC = compiler

  c) gmake - compiles code

2. Make and Run Instructions:
  
  a) gmake 
     - This compiles the code and unit test.

  b) gmake main_matchregex 
     - This compiles a binary, so stdin input and regexp_dataset.txt allows you to overload the 
       default regular expression
